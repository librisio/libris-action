# Integrating the Action into Your Repository

To facilitate automatic documentation updates within your repository, the workflow action requires write permissions and access to the GitHub-generated `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret. This guide outlines the steps to seamlessly integrate this action into your workflow.

In this guide we will set up the Libris Action in combination with a GitHub Page. Once set-up, every update pushed to your repository triggers the automatic publication of your latest documentation to your GitHub Page.

## Setting Up the GitHub Workflow File

Begin by creating a GitHub workflow action file named `libris.yaml` within the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. This action automates the documentation generation process, ensuring your project's documentation remains up-to-date with every push.

### Configuration Inputs:

* `config`: Specify the relative path to your Libris configuration file, which can be either a JSON or JavaScript file.
* `output`: Define the relative path for the output of the generated documentation.
            **Important**: The action will overwrite existing data at this location, so ensure the output path is correctly specified to avoid unintended data loss.

```

## Adding Your Libris API Key to Repository Secrets

For the action to access the Libris API, you must provide your Libris API Key as a secret in your repository.

1. In your repository navigate to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.
2. Click `New repository secret` to add a new secret.
3. Name the secret `LIBRIS_API_KEY` and paste your Libris API Key into the value field.

For more details on obtaining your Libris API Key, consult the [Libris documentation](https://uselibris.io/docs?id=Authentication:API%20Key).

## Optional: Enable GitHub Pages for Your Project

Elevate your project's visibility and accessibility by setting up a GitHub Pages site to host your documentation.

1. In your repository navigate to `Settings` > `Pages`.
2. Select `Deploy from branch` from section `Build and deployment` > `Source`.
3. Select branch `docs` from section `Build and deployment` > `Branch`. **This branch will not show up when the GitHub action has never been triggered.**
4. Select folder `/docs` from section `Build and deployment` > `Branch`.

By configuring GitHub Pages to deploy from the docs branch and the /docs folder, you ensure that every update pushed to your repository triggers the automatic publication of your latest documentation to docs:/docs/index.html. The GitHub Pages site will seamlessly update following the completion of the GitHub Action, presenting your project's documentation in a professional, accessible format.
